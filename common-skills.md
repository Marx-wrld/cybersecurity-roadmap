It hardly matters whether you are into SoC role or Network Security or AppSec or Cloud Security and so on, there are some common skill sets you should learn and be good at those.

**These skills are:**
1. [Linux Commands](#linux)
2. [Shell Scripting](#shell-scripting)
3. [Python or Go](#python-or-go)
4. [Computer Networks basics](#computer-networks-basics)

## Linux Commands
You don't need to be Linux nerd as a security professional but good hands-on over all linux commands would make you a better security person. 
Below are the three things which I think you should be good at.

_I am not mentioning any Security based Linux OS here, because if you are using those means you already know the important linux commands for your security job._

### 1. Understand Linux structure and its permission
1. Understand how file structure and different permissions work.
2. What are the commands related to permission change etc.
3. Where you can upload something, what's this /opt, /bin, /etc ...

### 2. Common Linux commands
It's not that you should me master at but should be aware all the necessary commands.
Some common commands I can think of are:
ls, cd, cp, scp, cat, uname, less, more, sort, ssh, mv, du, df, mount, mkdir, who, locate, chmod, chown, sudo, top, kill, grep, find, sed, awk, ps, zip, tar, service

What else you can think of as common linux commands for everyone? 

### 3. Internet and Networking Commands
These are the commands which are really helpful for security folks.
Some of them are:
ping, host, dig, nslookup, traceroute, nmap, tcpdump, whois, wget, curl, ifconfig
